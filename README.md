2. Introduction/Business Problem:

# What's the best neighborhood for you in Miami?

Located on the southern tip of mainland Florida, Miami teems with diverse cultural experiences, artwork, nightlife, and beauty. Living in and exploring Miami can be a total blast
if youâ€™re up for some adventure. However, finding the perfect home among roughly numerous Miami neighborhoods and municipalities can feel overwhelming. However, by grouping 
together neighborhoods with similar features, I can help you take a shortcut if you know what kind of a place you're looking for, no matter it's a quiet neighborhood with 
walkability, or a perfect viewing point with beach access. By showing those groups of neighborhoods on a map with distinct colors, you can see clearly where to look for your 
perfect stay in Miami.

3. Data Section:

To find all the neighborhoods and cluster them based on their features, we need the following data:

(1).A list of  neighborhoods in Miami City that includes neighborhood names, latitudes and longitudes, average rents and recent populations. 

(2).A list of  municipalities in Miami-Dade County, excluding Miami City area, that includes municipality names, latitudes and longitudes, average rents and recent populations.

(3).Foursquare data in JSON format for each neighborhood and municipality including venue names and catagories.
